  * Stop shipping upstream TODO file in libaio-dev.
  * List pathnames explicitly in debhelper .install fragment files, instead

    test suite mode.
  * Remove temporary forced flaky test suite run on architectures built under

      Otherwise the preprocessor emits warnings about redefinitions.
    - Split the architecture support patches into one per arch support.
    - Fix syscall definitions for hppa to match the kernel exactly.
    - Make __X32_SYSCALL_BIT an unsigned long constant to match the kernel.
    - Fix x32 structures padding.

    - Skip the test if io_pgetevents() is not implemented.
  * Switch to Standards-Version 4.5.0 (no changes needed).
  * Do not pass --add-udeb to dh_makeshlibs anymore, it's autodetected since
    debhelper 12.3, for which we add an explicit versioned Build-Depends.
  * Use correct syscall numbers for x32 port.
  * Make the testsuite fatal on architectures known to pass it, to avoid
    future regressions.
  * Temporarily force a flaky test suite run on architectures built under
    and emulator, to get test results.

 -- Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Apr 2020 19:06:49 +0200

libaio (0.3.112-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Sync with upstream commits:
    - Make test suite failures fatal, so we ignore errors for now, until it
      passes at least in all release architectures.
    - Add support for SKIPable tests.
    - Allow running tests against the installed library, which will make
      possible to add autopkgtests.
    - Fix test case 5.t, by using a write() instead of a read() to force the
      kernel to read from the unreadable buffer.
  * Add a workaround to io_pgetevents() for 32-bit userland running on
    64-bit kernels to cope with the broken compat kernel syscall, which uses
    a 64-bit pointer instead of a 32-bit one, and eats the sigset_t size
    member which makes it then fail a consistency check and return -EINVAL.
    This fixes test case 22.t. The kernel fix is being prepared as well.
  * Add more detailed error messages to test case 22.t.

  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 12.
  * Switch from debian/compat to debhelper-compat in Build-Depends.
  * Test suite fixes:

      it the WRITE call. Thanks to Jeff Moyer <jmoyer@redhat.com>.

 -- Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>  Fri, 02 Aug 2019 05:33:44 +0200

libaio (0.3.112-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Test suite fixes:
    - Fix logic inversion in EINVAL check.
    - Revert making the test suite fatal on failures, as the Debian buildd
      setup is peculiar enough to make at least two tests fail. This will
      need further work.

 -- Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Feb 2019 05:26:21 +0100

libaio (0.3.112-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    - Add fallback code for filesystems not supporting O_DIRECT.
    - Handle -ENOTSUP in addition to -EINVAL from io_submit() with RWF_NOWAIT.
    - The WRITE call does not change across different arches anymore.
    - Make the test exit with a code matching the pass/fail state.
      This will turn test suite errors into fatal build problems.

 -- Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Feb 2019 03:14:38 +0100

    - Split man page cleanup into logic changes, and further improve the
      formatting, markup, typo fixes, etc.
  * Use expanded symbol file instead of matching on symver. Even though
    upstream manages versioned symbols correctly, being explicit makes it
    safer against accidental changes.
  * Add a Build-Depends-Package field to the symbols file.
  * Only install upstream TODO into libaio-dev.
  * Remove support for old debug symbol package migration.
  * Add comment for dpkg-dev versioned Build-Depends.

  * Do not pass -fomit-frame-pointer as part of the required compiler flags.
  * Remove now always unused lintian override, as upstream requires linking
    against libc everywhere for its syscall(3) usage.
  * Mark libaio-dev as Multi-Arch same.
  * Now using Standards-Version 4.1.3 (no changes needed).
